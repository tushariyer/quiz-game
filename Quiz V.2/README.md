So this is the README file that git forced me to create when I made this repo.
Hooray, it's here. All our stuff is in that folder. The audio are clips from
who wants to be a millionaire, and i'm using the beta version of a Unity asset package called MaterialUI. It's $50 on the asset store, but the beta 
is on github, so I downloaded the beta. Might be worth mentioning that the 
asset package comes with the Apache license? Might not. Oh well.

INSTRUCTIONS
Alright, so run the game and choose 1280 x 800 as the resolution you want to 
play in. Make sure that you click 'windowed' and set graphics to 'fantastic'.

Hit 'Play!' and enjoy!
